###### Smith Jane
**English and US Literature student and part time customer sevice agent**
* *Hello, my name is Jane Smith, but my close friends call me Janey* *
I am a full time English and US Literature student at University of Essex and I also work part time as a customer sevice Agent for National Trust. I have recently finished a TEFL course which would soon allow me to change my part time job. I am originally from Romania but moved here four years ago to study. While working for National Trust I have become passionate about history and the story that lies behind stone walls and metal gates. I am also very dedicated to the study of languages, being fluent in english, romanian and spanish while currently learning turkish.
